About Database and collections:
	We'll have two database, pertaining main objective
	1: Database which will store High Tension Data
	2: Database which will store Low Tension Data

	"HT & LT Databases"

Collection: 
	HT :	sensors
			readings
	Sensors will be divided into two, master node and sensor node
	all master nodes are just sensors with added functionality

	But for HT most of the sensors will be masters, depending on the strategy preferred and particular sensor location

	example of readings collection 
	{
		"_id" : ObjectId("60c0d44894c10494260da31e"),
		"source" : "kitp-123",
		# "voltage" : {phase1: 223, phase2: 230, phase3: 220} ,
		"current" : {L1: 400, L2: 403, L3: 402},
		"ts" : ISODate("2021-05-20T10:24:51.303Z")
	}

	Eaxample of sensors collection
	{
		"_id" : ObjectId("60c0d44894c10494920da3op"),
		"name" : "kitp-123",
		"area_name": "kitopeni",
		"type": "sensor", // master or sensor
		"location": [32.872735723718374, 43.82397523678],
		"readings_ref" : ObjectId("60c0d44894c10494260da31e")
	}


	LT:	sensors
		readings
	Sensors here are similar to those on HT but with added parameters especially for those master nodes
	Most of the sensors in LT will just be sensor nodes with fewer master node
